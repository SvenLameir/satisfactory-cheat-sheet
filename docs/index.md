# Satisfactory Cheatsheet

## General Tips
- **Alt + Click**: Splits a stack in half.
- **Ctrl + Click**: Quickly transfer items between inventories.
- **Shift + Click**: Transfer entire stacks instantly.
- **Overclocking**: Overclock machines with Power Shards to increase production but be mindful of power consumption.

## Resource Management
- **Balancing Production**: Use calculators like [Satisfactory-calculator.com](https://www.satisfactory-calculator.com/) to plan efficient production lines.
- **Overflow Management**: Use overflow splitters and sink extra items to avoid production halts when storage is full.

## Transportation
- **Trucks/Trains**:
  - Trucks are better for early game short distances.
  - Use trains for long distances with high throughput.
  - Drones can be good or bad depending on the distance.

## Power Tips
- **Early Game**:
  - Use Biomass Burners, but automate biomass production to save time.
- **Mid-Game**:
  - Switch to Coal Power for a steady power source. Ensure water flow is sufficient for coal generators.
- **Late Game**:
  - Unlock Fuel Generators and Nuclear Power for higher energy output.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Use power switches to manage individual areas of your factory.

## Factory Design
- **Build in Layers**: Use foundations for easier organization.
- **Use Elevators**: Stack machines and belts vertically for compact designs.
- **Color Code Pipelines and Belts**: Use the color gun to mark important lines.
- **Plan Ahead**: Plan what you need, add a bit more, then double it!
